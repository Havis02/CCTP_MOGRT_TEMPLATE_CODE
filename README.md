In this repository, you will be able to see the code that is hidden within the submitted After Effects Project that control the rules, restrictions and customisation options for the video templates.

Each section of code shown here will have comments to describe how the code works and where to find it in the After Effects File submitted in this project.

The code is written in Adobe scripture which is an original version of JAVA Script.

Want to see the code in action? Download the MOGRT TEMPLATES in my final project submission to see how each line functions.
